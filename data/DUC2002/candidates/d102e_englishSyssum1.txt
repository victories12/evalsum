 Friends said some of the characteristics of her most famous role _ the zany, excitable star of television's ``I Love Lucy'' _ were evident during her childhood.
 In fact, when she was a plucky 15-year-old looking for that first break on Broadway, Miss Ball was told by a drama teacher to give up.
 The late Vivian Vance and William Frawley played their neighbors, Fred and Ethel Mertz.
 ``Lucy was a very funny woman,'' Hope said.
 Lucille Ball was born in Jamestown, N.Y., the daughter of an electrician and a concert pianist .
 ``I know everybody remembers her as zany and wacky but that was only on the show.
 Her timing, wails and pratfalls had made the "I Love Lucy" show one of the most popular in television history .
 CBS relented and her antics became comedy classics: Lucy putting too much yeast in the bread, which quickly fills up her kitchen and pins her against the wall; Lucy fighting with a fellow grape-presser in a giant wine-making vat; Lucy rehearsing a commercial for a health tonic and becoming drunk from its alcohol content .
 "My life started when my children were born," Miss Ball said at the time.
 Miss Ball, known for her honed comedic timing, wide-mouthed expressions and wacky antics, was popular among generations of fans who watched ``I Love Lucy'' as a first-run show in the '50s and in three decades of reruns.
 She was smart, hard-working and a perfectionist who knew that whatever else it was, comedy was not accidental .
 With Miss Ball's death today, all four are dead.
 Miss Ball and her late former husband, Desi Arnaz, starred in ``I Love Lucy'' from 1951 to 1957.
